## Instructor's Notes

1.  Review
    -   Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
        -   Put particular emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment
    -   Remind students about the iterative process of programming
        -   Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete the ["Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!"](lab_13.md) activity individually.
        -   Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
    -   When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.
3.  Debrief
    -   Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work
        -   If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through
        -   If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing
            -   Make sure course staff is available to help pairs who cannot figure out a given problem
    -   Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's programs
        -   Point out the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
    -   Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
-   Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
-   Students who have not yet taken geometry may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessaryâ€”the angles can be determined using trial and error.
    -   If students need more scaffolding, they can be pointed to an online resource such as <http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html>
    -   If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one of a square in part 1.1 to assist.
